1-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room, currently has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems. They would like to expand it to other operating platforms. Draw It     or Lose It is a multi-user game application that must have the ability to run multiple instances of the game at once, each having players and teams. The Gaming Room will have     200 high-definition image files to choose from, each one approximately 8 megabytes in size. The Gaming Room has asked me to evaluate the three traditional operating platforms     (Linux, Mac, and Windows), as well as mobile platforms, for how the game application software could be deployed and run and what would be required to do so. The client has         requested that I conduct an evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each platform and include your findings in the software design template. This will     help to inform their decision on the benefits of each platform and their utility in a distributed environment.
  
2-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
 - While developing this document I researched as much infomation as I could on each section. I gave unbias infomation about each platform as it pretained to this program.  
  
3-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
 - By working through the document it gave direction to the project by braking down each aspect. It gave the chance to look at each platforms advantages and disadvatages.
  
4-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 - The area I would revise would be the recomendation. I would improve it by giving more details on what I was recomending and why. By doing this it would give the client better     peace of mind on what I was recomending. 
  
5-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - By carfully reading the requirements provided by the client. Each step in the process gave more information to incorprate. The better you understand your users, the more likely   you are to design and build a service that works well for them. 
  
6-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
 - The approach was to utilize all information given by the client and design it to their needs. I found that by braking down each platform and learning the pros and cons of each     gave great insite to how to design the application. By listening to the client and analyzing each option we came up with the best option for the client.
